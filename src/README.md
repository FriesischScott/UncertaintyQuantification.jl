## Description of file structure

* __hpc__: files related to high performance computing interface
* __inputs__: random variables, parameters, copulas, imprecise variables
* __models__: surrogate models, `external models`, and wrapper models for imprecise propagation
* __modelupdating__: Bayesian model updating, and other calibration methods
* __reliability__: implementation probability of failure functions for various precise and imprecise simulators
* __sensitivity__: sensitivity analysis structs and methods
* __simulations__: structs for Monte Carlo, QMC, SubSet, etc, methods, and related sampling functions
* __util__: miscellaneous helper functions
