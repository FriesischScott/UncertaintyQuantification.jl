### First passage analysis of stochastic signals generated from a stochastic process approximated by the spectral representation method

In this example we will perform a first passage analysis of a stochastic process generated from a spectral representation model. 
The spectral representation method is a technique to approximate a stochastic process by a linear combination of sinusoidal functions. 
It is used to generate stochastic signals which can, for example, represent the ground motion of an earthquake. 

First passage analysis is a method to estimate the probability of a limit state being exceeded by a stochastic process. The limit state function is usually of the 
structure "limit state = capacity - demand", where the capacity is a constant value and the demand is the maximum absolute value of the stochastic signals. 
The probability of failure is then estimated by the fraction of the number of times the capacity is exceeded by the demand. For more information on the theory see [Reliability-Analysis](@ref).

For parallel execution, see the example in [OpenSees supported beam parallel](@ref)
