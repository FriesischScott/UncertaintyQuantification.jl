## OpenMC TBR uncertainty

In this example, we will run [OpenMC](https://openmc.org/), to compute the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) uncertainty, by varying material and geometric properties. This example was taken from the [Fusion Neutronics Workshop](https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop).

At first we need to create an array of random variables, that will be used when evaluating the points that our design produces.It will also define the range of the function we want the design to fit. This is also a good time to declare the function that we are working with.

Here we will vary the model's Li6 enrichment, and the radius of the tungsten layer.

# UQ will create subfolders in here to run the solver and store the results.

# Finally, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the probability of failure.

# The simulation results in `pf = 0.0064` and `σ = 0.001127` for `5000` samples. Also `TBR mean = 1.2404114576444423`, `TBR std = 0.10000460056126671`, and `TBR 95%: [1.0379178446904211, 1.4130216792418262]`.
