# UncertaintyQuantification.jl

A Julia package for uncertainty quantification. Current functionality includes:

* Simulation-based reliability analysis
  * Monte Carlo simulation
  * Quasi Monte Carlo simulation (Sobol, Halton)
  * Line Sampling
  * Subset Simulation
* Sensitivity analysis
  * Gradients
  * Sobol indices
* Metamodeling
  * Polyharmonic splines
  * Response Surface
* Third-party solvers
  * Connect to any solver by injecting random samples into source files
  * HPC interfacing with slurm
